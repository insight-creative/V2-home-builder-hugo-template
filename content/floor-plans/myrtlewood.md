  description: "Come home to your own private lodge retreat in the Myrtlewood. Craftsman detailing, window trim, lap siding and stone veneer wainscoting enlivens this contemporary angled farmhouse plan, designed for a corner lot. A triple set of king posts beneath gables and atop stone veneer posts adds an impressive visual flair to the vaulted, covered porch."
