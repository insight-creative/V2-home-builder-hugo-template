  description: "From street level, the Brewster 2 appears to be a charming 1 story house plan brimming with farmhouse style. Inside there is more than meets the eye. Slender posts frame the front covered porch giving friends and family a welcoming first impression. Inside the foyer is open to the great room. To the right behind a barn door is a mud room to keep coats, shoes, and bags organized and out of sight. Through the mudroom is the attached 1 car garage. Back at the entry, the great room fills the first floor. A warm fireplace is centered in the living room which seamless transitions to the dining and kitchen. The island with an eating bar provides some visual separation of the dining room and kitchen which is filled with modern appliances along with a generously sized walk-in pantry. Off the dining room, a hallway traverses the home and leads to the home office and master suite. Master suite features include a walk-in closet and private bathroom with soaking tub and separate shower."
